Product Vision:
For healthcare workers(Doctors, nurses, case manager etc) and Patients whose goal is to promote quality patient care through effective communication, The Patient Management System (PMS) is a cloud-based and smartphone-enabled application that will check individual patents, take online appointments, and report to a specific location at a specific time. Unlike the current PMS in which patients go to the hospital to receive their medical reports, patients who use the modified PMS will not only receive their medical reports online, but will also be able to discuss their reports with a specialist, saving them time and increasing patient and doctor satisfaction.
