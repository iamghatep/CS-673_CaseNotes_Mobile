Product Vision:
For healthcare workers(Doctors, nurses, case manager etc) and Patients whose goal is to promote quality patient care through effective communication, The Patient Management System (PMS) is a cloud-based and smartphone-enabled application that will check individual patients, take online appointments, and report to a specific location at a specific time. Unlike the current PMS in which patients go to the hospital to receive their medical reports, patients who use the modified PMS will not only receive their medical reports online, but will also be able to discuss their reports with a specialist, saving them time and increasing patient and doctor satisfaction.

Nearest Vision:
Our nearest vision is to develop the initial deliverable of case notes mobile app, which will have features that let patients and healthcare professionals (such as doctors, nurses, case managers, etc.) view appointment details. This app will get the details from the APIs exposed by the patient appointment portal. The app will also have a straightforward user interface (UI) that even non-technical users can understand.

PERSONA DETAILS:

**Laura, a family nurse practitioner**
 
Laura, age 40, is a family nurse practitioner in Chicago, which is among the largest cities in the U.S. She comes from a family where both of her parents were public servants through which they helped a lot of people. She likes interacting with and helping people in whatever way she can. She also volunteers after work. Laura has completed her education at Duke University with a degree in Doctor of Nursing Practice. She started practicing nursing as soon as she graduated and has been doing the job for the past 15 years.
 
She spends most of her time taking care of patients, writing reports on computers, or transcribing written reports into digital software. She finds this part of her job cumbersome and gets frustrated with how much time she must spend managing reports, as she would much rather spend time with her patients.
 
She has experience using various healthcare software. She believes that the use of software technology can help increase time with patients and consistency in managing reports and patient data. Laura is specifically interested in using Case Notes (Mobile App) to manage communication between doctors and nurses, and their patients. She believes using the application is a smoother way to rely on information from doctors to herself and her fellow nurses and then to the patients to ensure that there is no loss of information or miscommunication between each party and that each case is managed effectively.

 
**Rita, Pharmacist**

Rita, 35, is a pharmacist. She attended pharmacy school in Puerto Rico. After graduation, she worked for an independent pharmacy that was acquired by CVS. Rita believes in making a difference and cherishes the time she spends getting to know her patients. She demonstrates a strong work ethic and genuine optimism. Rita enjoys communicating with the residents of her neighborhood and hopes to have more chances to influence their lives. It involves more than just moving individuals through the line and filling pill bottles. It involves reminding patients to continue taking their medications on time, dispensing health advice, and ensuring that everyone has had their questions addressed before leaving.
 
Rita is sick of idling her time. She wants techs who are completely trained from the start so she won't have to waste any more time training them. She wants to assist in finding a solution to the issue of recruiting more competent technicians and wonders if there is a breakdown in the hiring process. She also wants a speedier computer system so that she can work more quickly. She might be processing more prescriptions rather than spending time by scrolling through a cumbersome system. Momentum is everything in this job for Rita. She is aware that if she pauses even for a split second, chaos will ensue and she will be left with a huge mess. She needs a faster computer system and better software to keep up with the workload.

This clinical information is further used for moving patients from hospital to home or from hospital to rehab.

Bernadette has used a lot of applications in the past at her previous jobs as a case manager.
